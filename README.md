## Problem Statement
Shortest path to reach one prime to other by changing single digit at a time. Given
two four-digit prime numbers, suppose 1033 and 8179, we need to find the shortest
path from 1033 to 8179 by altering only single digit at a time such that every number
that we get after changing a digit is prime. For example, a solution is 1033, 1733,
3733, 3739, 3779, 8779, 8179
